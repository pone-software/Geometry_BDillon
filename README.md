## Simulation and Reconstruction for P-ONE comparative geometry optimization ##
1. After generating a GCD file, move the file into the gcdfile repo
2. In the src_sim repo and src_spline repo, ensure that all paths are correct in each of the scripts
3. Run simulation steps, as described in the src_sim README
4. Run reconstruction steps, as described in the src_spline README
5. Run booking script to get final hdf5 file, as described in book_hdf5 README
6. Export hdf5 file
